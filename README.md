# NASA Space Apps Cairo 2024 Chatbot Prototype

## Overview

This project is a prototype of a chatbot developed to assist participants in understanding the challenges presented during the NASA Space Apps Cairo 2024. The chatbot leverages a MySQL database to store challenge-related information and uses natural language processing to interact with users effectively.

## Key Features

- **Database Integration**: The chatbot connects to a MySQL database containing detailed information about the challenges.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Utilizes language models to understand user queries and generate appropriate responses.
- **Speech Recognition**: Allows users to interact with the chatbot via voice commands, enhancing accessibility.

## Files Included

- **`chatbot.py`**: Main application file containing the chatbot logic and user interface built with Streamlit.
- **`database.sql`**: SQL script to create the necessary database schema for storing challenge data.
- **`data_processing.py`**: Script for processing challenge data and inserting it into the database.
- **`Test.py`**: Test file for verifying the chatbot functionality.
- **`mentors analysis.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook for analyzing mentor data.
- **`readme.md`**: Documentation file providing an overview of the project.
